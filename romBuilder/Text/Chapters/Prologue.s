Lyra! I heard rumors of Veil members gathering in Elderwood Grove.
[MidLeft]Yes, I need to stop them before they seize the ancient sigils!
[MidRight]And why should I care? I've seen enough bloodshed to last a lifetime.[CloseSpeech][MoveLeft][FarLeft][LoadMira]
You think you can just walk away? The power of the sigils is too great to ignore!
[MidLeft]I can't let them use that power for their own gain. We need to gather allies!
[FarLeft]Allies? You think anyone would follow a lost cause like yours?
[MidRight]I may be disillusioned, but I can't stand by while they threaten the world. I'll join you, but don't expect me to be your cheerleader.[CloseSpeech][X]

Elias! We did it! Mira is defeated!
[MidRight]I can't believe it. But this is just the beginning, isn't it?
[MidLeft]You know it is. The Veil won't stop until they have the sigils.
[MidRight]We need to rally the kingdoms. If we don't unite, they'll pick us off one by one.
[MidLeft]Right. We have to show them that together, we can stand against the darkness.
[MidRight]But how do we convince them? They've been at each other's throats for so long.
[MidLeft]We start by sharing our victory. If they see that we can defeat Mira, maybe they'll believe in hope again.
[MidRight]Hope... It's a fragile thing, but it's all we have now.
[MidLeft]Then let's not waste any time. We need to move quickly before the Veil regroups.
[MidRight]Agreed. For Eldralis![X]
