Impressive. I look[NL]

[TMM]...[......][TMM] It would be my honor.[A]
[MidRight]Wonderful! Welcome to the[NL]
Cesarian Army, Corporal.[A]
[Left]Thank you, Captain. What are my orders?[A]
[MidRight]Much of the brigade is diverted to the[NL]
west, fighting along the border with[A][NL]
Arcanae under the leadership of[NL]
Captain Jurgen. However, I have been[A][NL]
assigned to take some soldiers north[NL]
to Altia, in order to arrange a[A][NL]
treaty with their Anguis. I[NL]
leave the choice to you, Corporal.[A]
[Left][TMM]...[....][TMM] Jasper?[A]
[FarLeft]You got the promotion. I'll follow you[NL]
in whatever choice you make.[A][ClearFace][LoadDerek]
I don't have an opinion either way. We're[NL]
a team, aren't we? We'll stick together.[A]
[Left]Captain, I'd like to go to the border[NL]
and join the battle against Arcanae.[A]
[MidRight]Very well. I will have your post[NL]
assignments to you this evening. For now,[A][NL]
rest up. You'll be leaving tomorrow morning.[A]
[Left]Understood! Thank you, Captain![A]
[MidRight]Don't thank me yet...[A][X]

## Prologue_PassText
[FarLeft][LoadDerek][MidRight][LoadSylvaine][Left][LoadVillagerOldMan]
I'm sorry, but... I just don't feel[NL]
ready to take on this responsibility.[A]
[FarLeft]PLAYER_NAME, are you serious?[A]
[Left]Yes, Derek.[A]
[MidRight]Very well. It is your choice, after all.[NL]
Cadet Jasper, would you be willing to take[A][NL]
on leadership and the title of Corporal?[A][FarLeft][ClearFace][LoadJasper]
Are you sure about this, PLAYER_NAME?[A]
[Left]Yes! Just get on with it.[A][CloseSpeech][FarLeft][MoveLeft]
Right. Yes, Captain. I accept your offer.[A]
[MidRight]Very well. Congratulations, Corporal.[A]
[Left]What are our orders, Captain?[A]
[MidRight]The Emperor has been arranging for me to[NL]
go to Altia and meet with the Anguis[A][NL]
and High Priest to discuss terms of an[NL]
alliance. It seems like it would be a[A][NL]
fairly easy job for your squadron to[NL]
accompany me. Of course, if you'd[A][NL]
rather go to war against Arcanae, that[NL]
can also very easily be arranged...[A]
[Left]Yes, ma'am! Altia sounds wonderful.[NL]
It would be our honor.[A]
[FarLeft]Are you sure about this, Jasper?[A]
[Left]I'd rather we take steps to end the war this[NL]
way than just being three more corpses on[A][NL]
the border. I'm sure we'll still[NL]
see plenty of action, PLAYER_NAME.[A]
[FarLeft]If you say so, Jasper.[A]
[MidRight]Glad to hear of your decision, Corporal.[NL]
Welcome to the Leopard Brigade. Get[A][NL]
some rest, you three. We set out[NL]
early tomorrow morning.[A]
[Left]Yes, ma'am![A][X]

## Prologue_ChristinaComingText

Ready yourselves, cadets![NL]

## Prologue_ForrestComingText
[MidRight][LoadForrest]
You're lucky, cadets. The[NL]
enemy won't let you know[A][NL]
when they choose to strike![A][X]
