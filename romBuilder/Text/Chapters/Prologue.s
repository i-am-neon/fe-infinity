Lyra! We have urgent news about the Veil's movements.
[MidLeft]What is it, Eira?
[MidRight]There's a Veil operation underway in the ruins of Eldar. Malik is leading it.
[MidLeft]Malik... the one who seeks to awaken the Harbinger?
[MidRight]Yes. We must act quickly before he can unleash that power.
[MidLeft]We can't let that happen. We need to gather the others and head to the ruins.
[MidRight]I know the way. I can guide you through the forest.
[MidLeft]Thank you, Eira. Your knowledge is invaluable to us.
[MidRight]Just remember, I have my own reasons for stopping Malik. Let's move before it's too late![X]

Lyra! We did it! Malik is defeated!
[MidRight]Yes, but the ritual was only disrupted. We must remain vigilant.
[MidLeft]I never thought I would find myself fighting alongside you, Lyra. I was once part of the darkness.
[FarLeft]You think you can just walk away from your past, Eira? You were a traitor to your own kind!
[MidLeft]I know what I did, Malik. But I chose to fight for the innocent now. I won't let your twisted vision come to fruition.
[MidRight]Eira, your knowledge of the Veil is invaluable. Together, we can protect Eldralis from their grasp.
[FarLeft]You think you can stop the Harbinger? You are all fools! The Veil will rise again!
[MidLeft]Not if we have anything to say about it. We will unite the kingdoms and stand against you!
[MidRight]This is just the beginning. I vow to continue this fight, for my parents and for everyone who has suffered.
[FarLeft]You may have won this battle, but the war is far from over! [CloseSpeech][X]
