Kaelin! Have you heard the news?
[MidRight]What news, Liora?
[MidLeft]Nobles from Valoria, Elysia, and Nerath are gathering to discuss the Veil. It's our chance to unite the kingdoms!
[MidRight]I know. I intend to attend the meeting. We must rally support against this growing threat.
[MidLeft]But whispers of betrayal are already spreading. We need to be cautious.
[MidRight]Caution is important, but we cannot let fear hold us back. The Veil is a danger to us all.
[MidLeft]You're right. We must act swiftly. If Darius is involved, we'll need to be prepared for anything.
[MidRight]Darius... He's become a shadow of his former self, consumed by power. We must stop him before it's too late.
[MidLeft]I'll help you, Kaelin. Together, we can face whatever challenges lie ahead.
[MidRight]Thank you, Liora. With your skills in negotiation, we might just have a chance to sway the nobles to our side.
[MidLeft]Let's make our way to the gathering. The fate of our kingdoms depends on it! [CloseSpeech][X]

Kaelin! We did it! We pushed them back!
[MidRight]Yes, but at a cost. We lost many good people today.
[MidLeft]I know... But we must focus on the future. The nobles need to see the threat for what it is.
[FarLeft]You think they will unite? They are too busy squabbling over their own territories.
[MidLeft]They will have to. If they don't, the Veil will consume us all.
[MidRight]Liora is right. We need to rally them, show them that we can stand together against Darius and his forces.
[FarLeft]Darius... He won't stop until he has what he wants. We must be ready for his next move.
[MidLeft]Then we will prepare. I will not let his ambition destroy our kingdoms.
[MidRight]Together, we can forge a new alliance. One strong enough to face the darkness ahead.
[FarLeft]And what of the slumbering god? We cannot let it awaken.
[MidLeft]We will find a way to prevent that. I promise you, I will not fail.
[FarLeft]You carry the weight of your father's legacy, Kaelin. But remember, you are not alone in this fight.
[MidRight]Yes, we are all in this together. Let's unite our forces and show Darius that we will not be broken! [CloseSpeech][X]
