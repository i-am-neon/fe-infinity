[FarRight][LoadEira][MidLeft][LoadLyra]
Eira! We've reached the edge of the Whispering Woods.
[FarRight]Yes, but we must tread carefully. The Cult of the Abyss is rumored to be lurking here.
[MidLeft]And Korrin... I can't believe he's turned against us.
[FarRight]He was once a protector, but the Obsidian Sigil has twisted him. We must be ready for anything.
[MidLeft]We can't let him claim the sigil for himself. It's too dangerous in his hands.
[FarRight]Agreed. The spirits of the woods are counting on us to restore balance.
[MidLeft]Let's move forward, then. We'll confront Korrin and reclaim the woods for the Order of the Verdant Sigil.[X]

Korrin! Your reign of terror ends here!
[FarRight]You think you can defeat me? I will claim the sigil and bend this world to my will!
[MidLeft]You were once a guardian, Korrin. The sigil was meant to protect, not destroy!
[FarRight]Protect? Ha! The power of the Obsidian Sigil is beyond your comprehension!
[MidRight]Eira, what is the true power of the sigil?
[MidLeft][MoveLeft]It can unite the kingdoms against the Cult of the Abyss. We must not let it fall into the wrong hands!
[FarRight]You are a fool, Eira! The sigil belongs to me!
[MidRight]Not anymore! We will reclaim it!
[FarRight][MoveFarLeft]You think you can stop me? I will show you the true meaning of power!
[MidLeft]Together, we can restore balance to Eldralis!
[FarRight]You will regret this!
[MidRight]Lyra, now! Let's finish this!
[FarRight]No! This cannot be happening!
[MidLeft]The sigil is ours!
[FarRight][CloseSpeech][MidRight]With Korrin defeated, we must gather our allies. The fight against the darkness has only just begun.[X]
