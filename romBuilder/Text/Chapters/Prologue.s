Lyra! I can feel the disturbance in the forest.
[MidLeft]Eira, what do you mean?
[MidRight]The Veil's actions have awakened something dark. We must hurry to the heart of the woods.
[MidLeft]But what about the sigils? We need to find them before Kieran does!
[MidRight]I know where they are hidden. Follow me, and stay close. The spirits will guide us.
[MidLeft]Thank you, Eira. I don't know what I would do without your help.
[MidRight]We are not alone in this fight. Kieran will stop at nothing to claim the power of the sigils for himself.
[MidLeft]Then we must be ready. Together, we can protect the forest and its secrets.[X]

Lyra! We did it! Kieran has been defeated!
[MidRight]Yes, but at what cost? The battle was fierce, and the forest still bears the scars of conflict.
[MidLeft]The sigil is safe for now, but we must remain vigilant. The Veil will not give up so easily.
[FarLeft]You think you can stop me? I will return, and next time, I will claim the sigil!
[MidRight]Kieran, your ambitions will lead to your downfall. The spirits of the forest will protect what you seek to destroy.
[FarLeft]Spirits? They are nothing but whispers in the wind! I will awaken the slumbering god and gain power beyond your comprehension!
[MidLeft]You underestimate the bond between the forest and its guardians. Eira, will you stand with us?
[MidLeft]I pledge my allegiance to your cause, Lyra. I have knowledge of the sigils and the spirits that protect them. Together, we can prevent the Veil from achieving their goals.
[MidRight]Thank you, Eira. With your guidance, we can unite the kingdoms against the Veil.
[FarLeft]You may have won this battle, but the war is far from over! I will return!
[MidRight]Let him go. We have a greater purpose now. The Whispering Woods are safe, and we must move forward.
[MidLeft]Yes, let us leave this place and prepare for what lies ahead. The kingdoms need us now more than ever.[X]
