Lyra! We must act quickly. The Veil is threatening the Verdant Citadel!
[MidRight]I know, Elias. We can't let them take it. It's our home!
[MidLeft]Home? You speak of it as if it still holds any value. The world is cruel, Lyra.
[MidRight]But we can change that! We can protect it together!
[MidLeft]You have a naive view of the world. What makes you think we can succeed?
[MidRight]Because we have to try! If we don't stand up to them, who will?
[MidLeft]You have a point. I lost everything to the Veil. Perhaps this is my chance for redemption.
[MidRight]Then join me, Elias! Together, we can rally others and fight back!
[MidLeft]Fine. But don't expect me to trust anyone easily. I've seen too much.
[MidRight]That's okay. Trust will come with time. Let's move before it's too late! [CloseSpeech][X]

Elias! We did it!
[MidRight]I can't believe we actually defeated her. But this isn't over, is it?
[FarLeft]No, it isn't. The Veil's ambitions run deeper than we thought.
[MidRight]We need to stay vigilant. The Verdant Sigil is safe for now, but...
[FarLeft]But they will come for it again. We must prepare for the battles ahead.
[MidRight]Right. We can't let them reshape Eldralis into their twisted vision.
[FarLeft]We have to gather allies. We can't fight this war alone.
[MidRight]Agreed. Let's leave this citadel and find those who will stand with us.
[FarLeft]Together, we can push back the darkness.
[MidRight]For Eldralis!
[FarLeft]For Eldralis![X]
