  "description": `Description:
This map is set in an abandoned fortress that appears weathered and slightly overgrown. The structures are built from sturdy stone with fortified walls, giving a sense of age and endurance.
  1.	Central Hallway & Throne Room: The upper central area is a grand hall with a prominent red carpet, possibly a throne room or a gathering place for a high-ranking individual. The carpet leads to the back of the fortress, giving it an air of authority and significance. This room is flanked by tall, thick walls with narrow doors for entry, creating natural chokepoints.
  2.	Corridors & Chambers: Both sides of the central hallway have small rooms or chambers, likely used for storing supplies or as guard posts. These rooms are heavily fortified, with tall columns framing each entrance and small windows that offer limited visibility, likely for defense purposes.
  3.	Courtyard: The middle of the map features an open courtyard with patches of grass and scattered shrubbery, showing signs of nature reclaiming parts of the fortress. There’s a narrow path winding through the grass and bushes, leading from the central hallway down to a southern exit. This open space gives defenders a clear line of sight but also exposes anyone crossing to potential attacks.
  4.	Fortified Entrances: The lower part of the map has two larger fortified structures with similar architectural designs as the central fortress, possibly the entrance points or side buildings. These areas are more open than the main hallway, with broad, accessible entrances and slightly worn walls, suggesting that they might have been breached or frequently used.
  5.	Environmental Details: The map features rugged patches of green with natural growths, like small bushes scattered around the fortress grounds. This adds a sense of neglect or abandonment, as though the place has not been actively maintained or inhabited for some time.

Potential Gameplay Mechanics:
  •	Chokepoints: The narrow corridors and the throne room with limited access points provide opportunities for defensive strategies.
  •	Open Courtyard: This central area is risky for crossing due to its openness, making it suitable for ambushes or ranged attacks.
  •	Fortified Areas: Side chambers could serve as places to defend or retreat into during intense combat.`
