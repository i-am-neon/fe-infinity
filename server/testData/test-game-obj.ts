Despite his sheltered upbringing, he has an innate talent for understanding the complexities of magic, especially the dark allure of the sigils. Having witnessed the corruption of many around him, he is determined to uncover the truth about their powers and ultimately seek a way to reconcile humanity's ambition with the need for redemption. His strengths lie in his knowledge of ancient lore and his ability to commune with spirits, while his weaknesses include impulsiveness and an internal struggle with trust as he balances embracing power versus rejecting it. Torn between the pull of ambition and the fear of corruption, he embarks on a personal journey to prevent the return of the Slumbering One, believing that the only path to salvation lies through uniting the fractured factions of Eldralis and using their combined strengths against a common enemy.",
