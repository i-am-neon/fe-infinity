      age: "young adult",
      backstory:
        "Valenor hails from the lush fields of Valoria, where he grew up in a small village that thrived on the harmony between man and nature. As a child, he showed an affinity for the Verdant Sigil, a legacy from his ancestors who were once guardians of its power. However, as the corruption spread, he lost his family to the dark forces that twisted the sigil's essence. This traumatic event ignited a fire within him—a determination to protect his homeland and restore balance to nature. While strong-willed and brave, Valenor often struggles with feelings of inadequacy, fearing that he may not be powerful enough to make a difference. His journey will lead him to forge alliances with the divided clans of Drakthar and diplomats from Nerathis, all striving to stand against the shadowy Cult of the Slumbering God. Ultimately, he seeks to uncover the truth behind the ancient sigils and their connection to Eldralis's fractured state, hoping to unite the kingdoms and confront the darkness threatening to engulf their world. Valenor's heart lies in restoring harmony, not just for himself but for all who suffer from the corruption of the sigils as he yearns for a world where nature and humanity coexist peacefully again.",
