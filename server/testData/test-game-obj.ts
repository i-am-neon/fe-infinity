It feels as if something dark is creeping closer every day.\n[MidRight]We can't let it take our home. We must prepare to defend it.\n[MidLeft]But what about the sigil? I can feel its power, but it also feels... corrupted.\n[MidRight]The sigil? It might be the key to understanding what's happening. We need to find out more.\n[MidLeft]I agree. We should head to the hills where the villager disappeared. Maybe we can uncover the truth.\n[MidRight]Then it's settled. Let's move quickly before the darkness spreads further.[X]\n\n\n\n## the_shadows_gather_PostBattleReflection\n[ConversationText]\n[MidRight][LoadNythoria][FarLeft][LoadMira][FarRight][LoadElden]\n[FarRight]With Mira joining us, we have a chance to uncover the truth behind the sigils.\n[MidRight]Indeed. The Veil of Night's ambitions are more sinister than we imagined.\n[FarLeft]I can feel the weight of their darkness. We must act before it consumes Eldralis.\n[FarRight]I lost my family to the sigils' corruption. I won't let that happen to anyone else.\n[MidRight]Elden, your resolve is inspiring. Together, we can protect our home.\n[FarLeft]We need to gather more information. The spirits in the Nighthollow Marshes might hold the key.\n[FarRight]Then it's settled. We will confront this darkness head-on and reclaim our future!\n[MidRight]For Eldralis! We will not falter in the face of despair.[X]\n\n## Village_17c2093a_Text\n[ConversationText]\n[MidRight][LoadCurrent][MidLeft][LoadVillagerOldWoman]\nThank you for coming to aid us in our time of need! The Veil of Night seeks to ruin our village with their corrupted creatures. Please, take this tome; it holds powerful knowledge that may aid you in this battle. We must protect our home and the sigils at all costs!\n[A][X]\n\n## House_32c0d17e_Text\n[ConversationText]\n[MidRight][LoadCurrent][MidLeft][LoadVillagerOldWoman]\nOh, brave warrior! The Veil of Night's forces are relentless.\nYou must be careful and keep your wits about you.\nI've heard whispers that Zael seeks power through treachery.\nStay vigilant, and do not underestimate the darkness that comes.\n[A][X]\n\n## Village_77bce9c5_Text\n[ConversationText]\n[MidRight][LoadCurrent][MidLeft][LoadVillagerMan1]\nWelcome, traveler! I see you are here to help defend our village. The Veil of Night has sent waves of corrupted beings toward us, and I fear for the safety of our homes. Here, take this Purge as a token of our gratitude. It may help you against the darkness that looms ahead!\n[A][X]\n\n## Village_34d53248_Text\n[ConversationText]\n[MidRight][LoadCurrent][MidLeft][LoadVillagerWoman]\nI see you defending our village from the oncoming threat. The Veil of Night won't stop until they've claimed everything.\n[CloseSpeech]\n[MoveLeft]\n[MidRight][LoadVillagerWoman]\nTake this Silver Lance as a token of our gratitude. It may help you in the fierce battle against Zael and his corrupted minions. We believe in you-protect our home!\n[CloseSpeech]\n[A][X]\n\n## Recruit_Elden_Mira_Text\n[ConversationText][FarLeft][LoadElden][MidRight][LoadNythoria]Elden, have you felt the darkness creeping into our village? \n[FarLeft]It's suffocating. I can barely sleep with these whispers in my ears... \n[MidRight]We have to do something about it. The sigil you possess could be the key to understanding what's happening. \n[FarLeft]You think it could point us to the source?\n[MidRight][CloseSpeech]Yes, but we need to be cautious. The Veil of Night won't take kindly to our investigation. \n[FarLeft]Then we prepare for the worst. We've seen what these shadowy figures can do. \n[MidRight]Agreed. We must venture into the hills where the villager went missing.  \n[FarLeft]I'll gather my gear. It's time to show them we're not afraid. \n[MidRight]Stay sharp, Elden. Our village is counting on us.\n[A][X]\n\n## Recruit_Nythoria_Mira_Text\n[ConversationText][FarLeft][LoadNythoria][FarRight][LoadElden]\n[FarLeft]Elden, have you heard the whispers? Unseen forces are emerging. \n[FarRight]I have. The attacks have been growing bolder.\n[FarLeft]It's the sigil... I can feel its power attracting them.\n[FarRight]But what do they want? Why now?\n[FarLeft]Perhaps they seek to claim it for themselves. \n[FarRight]We need to defend our village. Those shadowy figures are a threat. \n[FarLeft]Yes, but I can't shake the feeling that there's more at play here. \n[FarRight]We must venture into the hills and find out more. A villager is missing...\n[FarLeft]Right, we can't let fear paralyze us. The villagers are counting on us.\n[FarRight]Then let's move quickly. We need to set up defenses.\n[FarLeft]And prepare for whatever is coming our way.\n[FarRight]Together, we'll protect our home. \n[CloseSpeech]\n[A][X]",

We can't let the sigils' corruption distract us from our goal.\n[FarRight]Elden is right. We must remain strong, for the sake of those who depend on us.\n[MidLeft]But what if I can't control it? What if the curse takes over?\n[MidRight]You are not alone in this fight. We will face it together.\n[FarRight]Look! Over there, a glimmer of light!\n[MidLeft]Could it be a sign? A way to the Veil's encampment?\n[MidRight]Let's move cautiously. We need to be prepared for anything.\n[FarRight]Remember, Nythoria, your strength is our strength. We believe in you.\n[MidLeft]Thank you, both of you. I will not falter. Let's go![X]\n\n\n\n## beneath_the_veil_PostBattleDialogue\n[ConversationText]\n[MidRight][LoadNythoria][FarLeft][LoadLysia][MidLeft][LoadElden][Right][LoadMira]\n[Right]We need to talk about what just happened. The Veil of Night has plans that go beyond our understanding.\n[MidRight]I know. Lysia, you were part of them. What do you know about the slumbering god?\n[FarLeft]Lysia: I... I believed in their cause. But now, I see the destruction it brings. The Veil intends to awaken the god to gain ultimate power.\n[MidLeft]We can't let that happen! We have to stop them, no matter the cost.\n[Right]But how? They have resources and allies we can't even begin to comprehend.\n[FarLeft]Lysia: I can help. I know their strategies, their weaknesses. I can be your ally.\n[MidRight]An ally? After everything? Why should we trust you?\n[FarLeft]Because I want to make things right. I've seen the horrors they unleash. I can't stand by any longer.\n[MidLeft]If we're going to fight, we need to be united. We can't let Mordecai's influence tear us apart.\n[Right]Then it's settled. We prepare for the confrontation ahead. For Eldralis.\n[MidRight]Together, we will seal the fate of the Veil of Night. We will not let darkness win.[X]\n\n## Village_6b96691d_Text\n[ConversationText]\n[MidRight][LoadCurrent][MidLeft][LoadVillagerWoman]\nWelcome, traveler! You look like you could use a hand. \nThe roads are treacherous with Mordecai's men lurking around every corner.\nHere, take this Bolagnone I had stashed away. It'll help you in the battle ahead.\nStay safe out there!\n[A][X]\n\n## Village_1ea48a94_Text\n[ConversationText]\n[MidRight][LoadCurrent][MidLeft][LoadVillagerWoman]\nThe battle ahead looks grim, but I believe in your strength! Take this Elysian Whip; it may help you in your fight against Mordecai and his deceptions. Equip it wisely to turn the tide.\n[A][X]\n\n## Village_b53cfe25_Text\n[ConversationText]\n[MidRight][LoadCurrent][MidLeft][LoadVillagerOldWoman]\nOh, what a day it is! The river's flow seems restless, just like the winds of battle that are brewing. You should take this Metiss Tome and use it wisely; it may well help you in facing the likes of Mordecai. He is a master of manipulation and his prowess in combat is not to be underestimated. Ensure that you and your allies are prepared to counter whatever tricks he may employ!\n[A][X]\n\n## Recruit_Elden_Lysia_Text\n[ConversationText][FarLeft][LoadElden][FarRight][LoadLysia]As we move towards the heart of Deidar, I sense the corruption growing stronger.\n[FarLeft]With these whispers echoing around us, it's hard to stay focused.\n[FarRight]Nythoria, can you resist its allure? We believe in you.\n[FarLeft][TMM][.......]... [.......][TMM]You have to stay strong. Your power can overcome this darkness! \n[FarRight]Look, there's a glimmer of light ahead. It might lead us somewhere safe.\n[FarLeft]If we don't confront this darkness together, we might lose ourselves. \n[FarRight]We can't allow the Veil to claim more souls. It's time to stand and fight! \n[FarRight]Why do you wish to defy the Veil? You have no idea what you're dealing with...\n[FarLeft]We're not afraid. Your plight is our own, Lysia. Join us, and let's fight back against the corruption together. \n[FarRight][TMM][.......]... [.......][TMM]But my former allies… they have been misled by the shadows. \n[FarLeft]We know the risk, but you can help us expose the truth! Show them the light! \n[FarRight]We believe in your strength, Lysia. You do not have to bear this burden alone. \n[FarRight][TMM][.......]... [.......][TMM]What if you fail? What if this only leads to more heartache?\n[FarLeft]Then we fight together! That's the only way to reclaim our fate. Will you lend us your strength? \n[FarRight]We can make it through this together, Lysia! Choose to turn back the darkness.\n[FarRight][TMM][.......]... [.......][TMM]Alright, I will join you... for now. Let's see if we can truly light the way.\n[A][X]\n\n## Recruit_Mira_Lysia_Text\n[ConversationText][FarLeft][LoadMira][MidRight][LoadNythoria]Nythoria, do you hear that? The whispers of the marsh are growing louder.\n[FarLeft]I can feel it too, Mira. It's as if they know we are coming.\n[MidRight]Stay focused. We cannot let fear cloud our purpose.\n[FarLeft]But what if we encounter the Veil?\n[MidRight]Then we will face them together. We must find the truth.\n[FarLeft]What truth is it that we seek?\n[MidRight]The sigil corruption-it's tied not just to the Veil but to the very essence of this land.\n[FarLeft][TMM][.......]... [.......][TMM]Mira, how can we restore the balance if the marsh itself is tainted?\n[FarLeft]I have heard the spirits whisper of a light that can pierce through the shadows. Perhaps the encampment ahead holds answers.\n[MidRight]A glimmer of hope among the darkness... we must investigate it.\n[FarLeft]We must approach with caution. The illusions could hide dire traps.\n[MidRight]Then let us stay vigilant. Together, we will navigate the treachery of these marshes.\n[FarLeft]And if we encounter Lysia? Will you be ready to approach her?\n[MidRight]I will show her the empathy she deserves-along with our strength. Perhaps that is the key to convincing her.\n[FarLeft][TMM][.......]... [.......][TMM]Let's move forward, but I hope we can reach her before the Veil does.\n[MidRight]We will. Our journey doesn't end here. We will fight for those who can't fight for themselves.\n[A][X]\n\n## Recruit_Nythoria_Lysia_Text\n[ConversationText][FarLeft][LoadNythoria][MidRight][LoadLysia]Nythoria, are you alright? \n[FarLeft]I'm... struggling with this weight. \n[MidRight]You have to stay focused. Remember why we're here. \n[FarLeft]I know, but these whispers... they remind me of my past. \n[MidRight]Your past is part of you, but it doesn't define you. \n[FarLeft]What if I fail again? \n[MidRight]You won't. Trust in your strength, and in us. We're in this together. \n[FarLeft]Together, right... \n[MidRight][TMM][.......]... [.......][TMM]Look ahead! Is that light? \n[FarLeft]Could it lead us to the encampment?  \n[MidRight]It's our best lead. Stay strong! \n[FarLeft]I will.  \n[MidRight]Look, we need to be tactful. There are enemies entrenched ahead. \n[FarLeft]The terrain around here is tricky, but we can use it to our advantage.\n[MidRight]Exactly! Let's move through the Eastern Forest for cover, then flank them! \n[FarLeft]Right! When we reach the river, we must be careful. We need those bridges. \n[MidRight]If we position ourselves well, we can force them into a bad spot. But... \n[FarLeft]What if they turn on us? \n[MidRight]Then we have to show them who we are. We need to demonstrate empathy and strength. \n[FarLeft]Empathy, yes... I understand now. \n[MidRight]You'll see that can change minds; it could sway Lysia's allegiance. \n[FarLeft]Then let's move forward together! \\n\n[A][X]",
