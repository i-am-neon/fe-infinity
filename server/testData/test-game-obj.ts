The Elysian Fields are where the Order of the Verdant Sigil is rallying support against the Veil.\n[MidRight]Then let me help you. My skills in negotiation can bring more warriors to your cause.\n[MidLeft]You would do that for me?\n[MidRight]Of course! I may be a lone wolf, but I can't stand by while our homes are destroyed. \n[MidLeft]Thank you, Liora.

The Veil will not take this lightly.\n[MidRight]We have the support of the warriors of Valoria now. We can turn this victory into a rallying cry!\n[MidLeft]True, but I can't shake the feeling that this is just the beginning. The Veil's true intentions are still shrouded in darkness.\n[MidRight]We must stay vigilant. I won't let my past mistakes dictate our future.\n[MidLeft]Your past is a part of you, Zephyra. But it doesn't define you. You have the strength to lead us forward.\n[MidRight]Thank you, Liora. Together, we can face whatever comes next. We owe it to those who fought and fell today.\n[MidLeft]And to those who still suffer under the Veil's shadow. We will not let their sacrifices be in vain.\n[MidRight]Let's gather the warriors and prepare for the next phase of our journey. The fight for Eldralis is far from over.[X]",

Her affinity for nature and deep connection to the sigils marked her as one of the most talented initiates. However, tragedy struck when her village fell victim to a raid orchestrated by the Veil seeking to acquire her sigil for their dark purposes. As the sole survivor, she is driven by guilt and a burning desire for redemption.

Zephyra seeks not only to avenge her lost village but also to understand the true nature of the sigils and to prevent others from suffering the same fate. Her journey leads her to forge unexpected alliances, confront former enemies, and learn the value of sacrifice in the face of overwhelming darkness.",
