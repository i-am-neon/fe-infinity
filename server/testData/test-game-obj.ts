They won't listen to just one voice.\n[MidLeft]You have a gift, Zyphine. They will listen to you.\n[MidRight]What about Kaden? I heard he has been seen with the Veil's forces.\n[MidLeft]Yes, he was once a respected member of the council. Now, he seeks power at any cost.\n[MidRight]We can't let him sway the council. We must warn them!\n[MidLeft]Agreed. But we must tread carefully. Kaden's influence is strong.\n[MidRight]Then let's gather the elders and confront this threat together!\n[MidLeft]Yes, together we can stand against the darkness. We must act before it's too late.[X]\n\n## PostBattleConfrontation\n[ConversationText]\n[MidRight][LoadElysia][MidLeft][LoadZyphine][FarLeft][LoadKaden]\nZyphine! You did well in the battle, but we must confront Kaden now.\n[MidRight]Elysia, I... I can feel the weight of the sigils. They take so much from us.\n[MidLeft]You must stay strong, Zyphine. Kaden's vision for Valoria is twisted. We cannot let him succeed.\n[FarLeft]You think you can stop me? The sigils are the key to true power! Embrace them, Zyphine!\n[MidLeft]Kaden, you've lost your way. The sigils corrupt, they destroy lives!\n[FarLeft]And yet, they can also create a new world! A world where I am in control!\n[MidRight]Zyphine, remember your mother. The sigils took her from you. You must fight against this madness!\n[MidLeft]Elysia is right. We can't let Kaden manipulate the sigils for his own gain.\n[FarLeft]You're all fools! Valoria will bow to me, and you will be nothing but a memory!\n[MidRight]No, Kaden! We will unite against you! Together, we can overcome the darkness!\n[MidLeft]Zyphine, let's show him the strength of our resolve!\n[FarLeft]You think you can defeat me? I will show you the true power of the sigils!\n[MidRight]We will not back down! For Valoria!\n[MidLeft]For Valoria![X]",

        "Zyphine hails from the fertile fields of Valoria, born into a family of farmers. As a child, she found a sigil buried in the soil of her family's land, granting her an ability to influence plant growth, but also, slowly corrupting her spirit. She witnessed the effects of the sigil first-hand when her mother succumbed to its madness, leading Zyphine to develop a strong aversion to their use. This trauma strengthened her resolve to unite the fractured kingdoms, believing that only together could they confront the Veil and the madness the sigils bring. Zyphine's loyalty to her friends and a deep sense of justice motivate her to protect those around her, but her fear of losing others, like she lost her mother, often leads her to push them away. Her journey is one of self-discovery and loving acceptance of the past, showing her that true strength lies not in isolation but in community.",
