We need to talk about Garrick and his mercenaries.\n[MidLeft]I know, Elysia. The reports say he's been raiding villages, exploiting the chaos for his own gain.\n[MidRight]It's dangerous to confront him directly. We need a plan.\n[MidLeft]You're right. But we can't just sit back and let him destroy everything we care about.\n[MidRight]I understand your passion, but we must be cautious. We need allies.\n[MidLeft]Then let's gather our friends and prepare for battle. We can't let Garrick's ambition go unchecked!\n[MidRight]Alright, I'll scout the area and see if I can find anyone willing to join us.\n[MidLeft]Good idea! We need all the help we can get. Together, we can stop him!\n[MidRight]For the Kingdom of Solandria![X]\n\n\n\n## the_awakening_shadows_PostBattleScene\n[ConversationText]\n[MidLeft][LoadThirelyn][MidRight][LoadElysia]\nThirelyn! We did it! Garrick is defeated!\n[MidLeft]Yes, but at what cost? The sigils have spread their corruption far and wide.\n[MidRight]The villagers are grateful, but I fear this is only the beginning of our struggle.\n[MidLeft]We must unite the kingdoms against the Silent Order. They won't stop until they have total control.\n[MidRight]I agree. We need to gather allies and confront this darkness head-on.\n[MidLeft]I won't let my parents' sacrifices be in vain. We will restore harmony to Eldralis!\n[MidRight]Together, we can make a difference. Let's regroup and plan our next move.\n[MidLeft]For Eldralis! We will fight for a brighter future![CloseSpeech][X]\n\n## House_4934954e_Text\n[ConversationText]\n[MidRight][LoadCurrent][MidLeft][LoadVillagerOldMan]\nThe conflict with Garrick's mercenaries is a dire situation. We must stand united to protect our homes. Be cautious, traveler; they are ruthless and quick to attack. Don't let them catch you off guard.\n[A][X]\n\n## House_40565e65_Text\n[ConversationText]\n[MidRight][LoadCurrent][MidLeft][LoadVillagerOldMan]\nThe mercenaries led by Garrick are ruthless! \nIf you confront them in the fields, stay alert. \nDon't let their numbers overwhelm you. Trust in your instincts, \nand remember, protecting the villagers is just as important as defeating Garrick. \n\n[A][X]\n\n## Village_24a11f54_Text\n[ConversationText]\n[MidRight][LoadCurrent][MidLeft][LoadVillagerMan1]Elysia! It's good to see you! We are terrified of the mercenaries that have been roaming our fields. Please, take this Arms Scroll! You may need it to help fend off Garrick and his forces. We trust you to protect our home!\n[A][X]\n\n## Recruit_Thirelyn_Elysia_Text\n[ConversationText][MidLeft][LoadThirelyn][MidRight][LoadElysia]Elysia, are you ready for this? We can't let Garrick take advantage of the chaos in Solandria.\n[MidLeft]I've been preparing for this moment, Thirelyn. I've seen what Garrick and his mercenaries can do.\n[MidRight]Then we must act swiftly. We need to gather allies wherever we can and confront him before he gains more power.\n[MidLeft]But we can't underestimate him. He knows the land as well as we do, and he will use any advantage he can find.\n[MidRight]That's why we must outsmart him. We have the people on our side-they believe in us, in our cause.\n[MidLeft]True, we can use the villagers to our advantage. We can rally them to help us defend their homes.\n[MidRight]Yes! The more support we have, the stronger we will be against his mercenaries.\n[MidLeft]Let's head to the Golden Fields. It's a vast place; we'll find a way to use the terrain to our advantage-and Elysia, your archery skills will be key.\n[MidRight]I'll do my best. Together, we can change the fate of our kingdom.\n[MidLeft]Then it's settled. For Solandria, we march forward and face Garrick![CloseSpeech]\n[A][X]",

Driven by memories of her parents' sacrifices and the hope of a better future for Eldralis, Thirelyn embarks on a journey to unite the fractured kingdoms against the Silent Order, vowing never to let darkness claim her home again.
