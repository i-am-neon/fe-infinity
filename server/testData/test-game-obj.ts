This summit is our chance to unite the kingdoms.\n[MidRight]I hope so, Elysia. But I sense unrest in the air. Whispers of betrayal...\n[MidLeft]We must stay focused on our goal. The future of Eldralis depends on our unity.\n[MidRight]You're right. But with leaders from different factions, tensions are bound to rise.\n[MidLeft]I believe in the power of diplomacy. If we can show them the strength of cooperation, we can overcome anything.\n[MidRight]And what of Garrick? His ambitions could threaten everything we've worked for.\n[MidLeft]We must be vigilant. If he tries to sow discord, we will stand against him together.\n[MidRight]Together, then. For the sake of peace in Eldralis!\n[MidLeft]For peace! Let's prepare for the summit and face whatever challenges lie ahead.[X]\n\n\n\n## the_gathering_storm_PostBattleScene\n[ConversationText]\n[MidRight][LoadElysia][MidLeft][LoadZalvynn]\nElysia! With Garrick defeated, we can finally move forward.\n[MidRight]Yes, Zalvynn. The summit is regaining momentum, and our efforts are starting to bear fruit.\n[MidLeft]I never doubted our cause. Unity is our greatest strength against the Nox Aeternum.\n[MidRight]Indeed. We must form a coalition, and I believe the other leaders will agree.\n[MidLeft]But we must remain vigilant. The threat of the shadowy order looms larger than ever.\n[MidRight]I know. Our journey is far from over, but together, we can face whatever comes next.\n[MidLeft]Let's gather the leaders and solidify our alliance. The future of Eldralis depends on it.[X]\n\n## House_33376d08_Text\n[ConversationText]\n[MidRight][LoadCurrent][MidLeft][LoadVillagerOldWoman]\nAh, you've come to our humble village!\nThere are whispers about Garrick's forces\nmaking their way here... Do not take\nthem lightly. Be wary and keep your\nallies close. Safety in numbers, young\none.\n[A][X]\n\n## Village_66ec18be_Text\n[ConversationText]\n[MidRight][LoadCurrent][MidLeft][LoadVillagerOldMan]\nWelcome, traveler. Times are dark with Garrick's forces stirring up trouble for the summit. I hear whispers of conflict, and many fear for their safety.\n[CloseSpeech]\n[MidRight]But look here, I've saved something for brave souls like you. Take this Brave Bow. Use it wisely against his treachery, and may it aid you in protecting our hopes for a united Valestor.\n[CloseSpeech]\n[A][X]\n\n## House_040a4e3e_Text\n[ConversationText]\n[MidRight][LoadCurrent][MidLeft][LoadVillagerOldMan]\nThis place has seen better days... The factions are at each other's throats, and word is that Garrick plans something vile at the summit. Stay vigilant, traveler. It would be wise not to underestimate him.\n[A][X]\n\n## House_fdb64513_Text\n[ConversationText]\n[MidRight][LoadCurrent][MidLeft][LoadVillagerOldMan]\nIn these troubled times, keep your wits about you. The Northern Plains may seem inviting, but backstabbers lurk in the shadows, eager to take advantage of any weakness. Stay vigilant, and trust not just anyone. There's a storm brewing, and it is said Garrick will make his move soon...\n[A][X]\n\n## Village_4ec86f7e_Text\n[ConversationText]\n[MidRight][LoadCurrent][MidLeft][LoadVillagerWoman]\nThe village is on edge with rumors of the approaching conflict. We're trying to remain hopeful, but it's hard with Garrick's forces looming. Please, take this Dasher to help you speed away if danger comes too close.\n[A][X]",

We must stay focused as we approach the Shadow Cathedral.\n[MidLeft]I know, Zalvynn. But the whispers in the shadows... they unsettle me.\n[MidRight]We cannot let fear guide us. Kael, you know more about the Nox Aeternum than any of us. What can you tell us?\n[FarRight]Their plans are shrouded in darkness, but I have seen their rituals. They seek to resurrect a slumbering god, one that will bring chaos to Eldralis.\n[MidLeft]A god? That sounds like a nightmare. We must stop them at all costs!\n[MidRight]Exactly. If we can disrupt their plans at the Cathedral, we might save countless lives.\n[FarRight]But be warned, Lirael will be waiting for us. She is cunning and will not hesitate to use her power against us.\n[MidLeft]Then we must be prepared. Together, we can face whatever darkness lies ahead.\n[MidRight]For unity! For Eldralis!\n[FarRight]For redemption... and for those who have fallen before us.[X]\n\n\n\n## shadows_of_the_past_PostBattleScene\n[ConversationText]\n[MidRight][LoadElysia][MidLeft][LoadZalvynn][FarLeft][LoadKael]\nElysia! We did it! Lirael is defeated!\n[MidRight]Yes, but at what cost? The Nox Aeternum's plans are still in motion.\n[MidLeft]We need to gather what we can from her remains. There must be clues about their next move.\n[FarLeft]I can help with that. I know their methods well. \n[MidRight]Kael, your knowledge is invaluable. We need to stay one step ahead of them.\n[MidLeft]The darkness is far from over. We must prepare for the true battle ahead.\n[FarLeft]I understand that now. I thought defeating Lirael would bring closure, but it only reveals the depth of the shadows we face.\n[MidRight]Together, we can face whatever comes next. Unity is our strength.\n[MidLeft]Let's uncover the truth and protect Eldralis from the darkness that looms over us.[X]\n\n## Recruit_Elysia_Kael_Text\n[ConversationText][FarLeft][LoadElysia][FarRight][LoadZalvynn]As we tread deeper into Umbralis, the shadows cling to us like thick fog.\n[FarLeft]We must remain vigilant, Zalvynn. The Nox Aeternum won't hesitate to strike.\n[FarRight]I understand, Elysia. The weight of my past is heavy, but we must push forward.\n[FarLeft]What of your past with them? What can you tell us?\n[FarRight]When I was with them, their ambitions were shrouded in secrets... But I learned enough to foresee their plans. \n[FarLeft]Then guide us, Kael. We can turn that knowledge to our advantage.\n[FarRight]The Shadow Cathedral is a labyrinth, and Nox Aeternum are just as cunning.\n[FarLeft]We must not let fear paralyze us. Unity will be our strength.\n[FarRight]Agreed. In the Upper Hallway, we need to position ourselves carefully to avoid ambush.\n[FarLeft]And in the Central Courtyard, we can maneuver to outflank them. Let them underestimate our resolve.\n[FarRight]We shall reclaim this territory, one step at a time. The shadows will not consume us!\n[FarLeft][TMM][.......]... [.......][TMM]Remember, Elysia, if my past can remind us of the light, it is worth it.[ClearFace]\n[FarRight]It is time to move. The future of Eldralis depends on us.\n[A][X]\n\n## Recruit_Zalvynn_Kael_Text\n[ConversationText][MidLeft][LoadZalvynn][FarRight][LoadKael]This place gives me a sense of dread.\n[MidLeft]It's not just the shadows, Kael. They hold secrets we need to uncover.\n[FarRight]I understand. This is where I first encountered the Nox Aeternum. They are more dangerous than you can imagine.\n[MidLeft]You've been through a lot. What can you tell us about their plans?\n[FarRight]They crave power above all else. And they won't hesitate to destroy anyone in their path, even those close to them.\n[MidLeft]We must be careful then. Every step could lead us deeper into their web of lies.\n[FarRight]Trust your instincts, Zalvynn. They may try to deceive us, but I believe in your ability to navigate through.\n[MidLeft]Thank you, Kael. I will hold onto that trust as we face whatever lies ahead. [TMM][.......]... [.......][TMM]But I fear that my sigil may lead me down a darker path than I anticipated.\n[FarRight][MoveLeft]Do not let the power consume you. We can confront the darkness together.\n[MidLeft]Then let's move forward. Together, we will shine a light in this cathedral of shadows.\n[A][X]",

We've come so far, but the battle ahead will be our greatest challenge yet.\n[MidLeft]I can feel the weight of it all. Malakar and the Nox Aeternum will not go down easily.\n[FarLeft]But we have each other. Together, we can overcome any darkness that threatens Eldralis.\n[FarRight]Elysia is right. Our unity is our strength. We must not lose hope.\n[MidRight]Let us share our hopes and fears, and strengthen our resolve before we face the enemy.\n[MidLeft]I fear for the lives we may lose, but I believe in our cause. We fight for a brighter future.\n[FarLeft]And I will fight to protect those who cannot protect themselves. We cannot let Malakar win.\n[FarRight]For every life lost, a new hero will rise to take their place. We must honor their sacrifice by fighting with all our might.\n[MidRight]Then let us prepare ourselves. The fate of Eldralis rests in our hands.[X]\n\n\n\n## the_final_confrontation_PostBattleReflection\n[ConversationText]\n[MidRight][LoadZalvynn][MidLeft][LoadElysia][FarLeft][LoadKael][FarRight][LoadThorne]\nThe battle is over, but the scars remain.\n[MidRight]We fought valiantly, but at what cost?\n[MidLeft]Every sacrifice brings us closer to peace, Zalvynn.\n[FarLeft]Elysia is right. We must honor those who fell by forging a brighter future.\n[FarRight]And we will. Together, we can ensure their sacrifices were not in vain.\n[MidRight]Malakar's defeat is just the beginning. The shadows may linger, but we have the light of hope.\n[MidLeft]Hope is a fragile thing, but it can grow stronger with unity.\n[FarLeft]Let us not forget the bonds we've forged. They are our greatest strength.\n[FarRight]As the sun rises, we must rise with it, ready to face whatever comes next.\n[MidRight]For Eldralis, for our fallen comrades, and for a future free of darkness.[X]\n\n## House_2e3a1117_Text\n[ConversationText]\n[MidRight][LoadCurrent][MidLeft][LoadVillagerMan1]\nWe are on the brink of disaster! Malakar's forces are closing in, and we need to remain vigilant.\nBut beware! They may attack from the cliffs or the bridges.\nKeep your guard up!\n[A][X]\n\n## House_735add0c_Text\n[ConversationText]\n[MidRight][LoadCurrent][MidLeft][LoadVillagerOldMan]\nThis battle against Malakar will test your strength and resolve. Don't underestimate his manipulative tactics; he has a way of turning allies against each other. Trust in your companions, and remember to watch your back. Stay vigilant!\n[A][X]\n\n## Village_3f3c2cb5_Text\n[ConversationText]\n[MidRight][LoadCurrent][MidLeft][LoadVillagerMan1]\nHello there, traveler! Take a moment to rest. This village has seen many struggles, but we still have hope. \n\n[CloseSpeech]\n[Right]I heard whispers that Malakar is planning something terrible. You need all your strength for this battle ahead! \n\n[CloseSpeech]\n[MidLeft]Before you go, please accept this gift from us-it's a special Fortify gemstone. It should give you the strength to withstand the dark forces to come. \n\n[CloseSpeech]\n[Left][MoveLeft]We've been preparing for the worst, so keep your wits about you out there. Good luck! \n\n[CloseSpeech]\n[A][X]\n\n## Recruit_Elysia_Thorne_Text\n[ConversationText][FarLeft][LoadElysia][FarRight][LoadThorne][MidRight][LoadKael]As the final assault draws near, the air is thick with anticipation.\n[FarLeft]Elysia, do you think we have what it takes to stand against Malakar's forces?\n[FarRight]It's not just about strength, Thorne. We must trust in our unity and our resolve.\n[MidRight]Well, we have come this far together. I believe in our coalition.\n[FarLeft]Every step of this journey has brought us closer. We must remember that.\n[FarRight]True, our bond is our greatest weapon. Even in the face of despair.\n[MidRight]I fear what happens if we fail.\n[FarLeft]We won't fail. We have to embody hope for those who cannot fight.\n[FarRight]Elysia is right. We fight not just for ourselves but for the future of Eldralis.\n[MidRight]The stakes have never been higher. Let us stand strong together.\n[FarLeft]Together, we are unstoppable. Let's show Malakar the strength of our unity!\n[FarRight]For Eldralis! [CloseSpeech]\n[A][X]\n\n## Recruit_Kael_Thorne_Text\n[ConversationText][MidLeft][LoadZalvynn][MidRight][LoadThorne][FarRight][LoadElysia]As our final assault draws near, we must reflect on how far we've come.\n[MidLeft]I still remember the day we first met, how unsure we all were.\n[MidRight]What matters is that we've grown stronger together.\n[FarRight]And now, we stand united against Malakar.\n[MidLeft]Kael, what about you? What are your hopes for this battle?\n[FarRight]I want to ensure no one else suffers like I have.\n[MidRight]Redemption, then? \n[MidLeft]It's a noble goal, Kael. \n[FarRight]It is, but the path can be fraught with uncertainty.\n[MidRight]Our resolve must not waver. We fight for our future!\n[FarLeft][CloseSpeech]\n[Left]And what if we fail? \n[MidRight]We won't. We have each other, and we fight for the people of Eldralis.\n[FarRight]Indeed. It's our strength in unity that keeps the darkness at bay.\n[FarLeft][TMM][.......]... [.......][TMM]I'll continue to fight, as long as I have my friends by my side. I won't let my past dictate my future.[Smile]\n[MidLeft]Then let's make this assault count and show Malakar the true power of our coalition!\n[MidRight]Together!  We will forge a new path!\n[A][X]\n\n## Recruit_Zalvynn_Thorne_Text\n[ConversationText][FarLeft][LoadZalvynn]\nAs we gather for this final assault, it's hard not to reflect on how far we've come.\n[FarRight][LoadThorne]\nIndeed, Zalvynn. It feels like only yesterday we were strangers, each wrestling with our own burdens.\n[MidLeft][LoadElysia]\nBut now, we face a common enemy. I can feel the weight of our resolve.\n[MidRight][LoadKael]\nMalakar underestimates us. We've grown stronger together, united in purpose.\n[FarLeft]We'll need every ounce of that strength. The Nox Aeternum will not show mercy.\n[FarRight]And neither will we. I've seen too much suffering to let it continue.\n[MidLeft]What are your fears, friends? What haunts our hearts as we prepare for this battle?\n[MidRight]It's the fate of Eldralis that weighs on me. Will we be able to overcome the darkness?\n[FarRight]If we fight as one, we can. This is our time to shine, to light the way forward.\n[MidLeft]Your confidence bolsters my spirit. We must harness our skills, our knowledge, and our determination.\n[FarLeft]Together, we are more than just individuals-we are a coalition of hope, ready to confront the darkness.\n[FarRight][TMM][.......]... [.......][TMM]Let's turn our fears into fire, igniting the light of resistance.[CloseSpeech][CloseSpeech]\n[MidLeft]To victory then, for Eldralis![CloseSpeech]\n[A][X]",
