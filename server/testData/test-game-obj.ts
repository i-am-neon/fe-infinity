I need your help to unite our people against the Shadow Hand.\n[FarRight]Ronan: Why should I? I failed once before.

We can't let the darkness win!\n[FarRight]Ronan: You don't understand the weight of my past. I lost everything to them.\n[MidLeft]Elowyn: I know the pain of loss, but we can't let it consume us.

The promise of unity is too strong to ignore.\n[FarRight]Elowyn: Together, we can uncover the shadowy machinations of the Shadow Hand. We must remain vigilant.\n[MidRight]Ronan: I have trained for years in solitude, but now I feel ready to face whatever comes next.\n[MidLeft]Sira: The forest has shown me the way.

The Shadow Hand's presence looms over us.\n[FarRight]Darin: You think you can just waltz in there? The citadel is protected by those who will not hesitate to fight.\n[MidLeft]I understand your concern, but we seek knowledge, not conflict. We must confront the guardian, Elysia, and prove our intentions.\n[FarRight]Prove your intentions? You think she'll listen to a bunch of outsiders?\n[MidLeft]We have to try. The fate of Eldralis depends on it.\n[FarRight]And what if she sees you as a threat? You'll be fighting for your lives.\n[MidLeft]Then we will fight, but we will not lose hope. Together, we can face whatever comes our way.\n[FarRight]You're either brave or foolish. I can't decide which.\n[MidLeft]Perhaps a bit of both. But I believe in our cause, and I believe in you, Darin. Join us, and let's face this challenge together.\n[FarRight]You really think I can just turn my back on everything I've known? \n[MidLeft]You can forge a new path, one that leads to redemption. Let's uncover the truth behind the sigils and protect our home.\n[FarRight]Fine. I'll help you, but don't expect me to trust you right away.\n[MidLeft]That's all I ask. Let's move forward, together.[X]\n\n\n\n## the_peaks_of_truth_PostBattleScene\n[ConversationText]\n[MidRight][LoadElowyn][MidLeft][LoadRonan][FarLeft][LoadSira][FarRight][LoadDarin]\nElowyn! We did it! The Shadow Hand has been pushed back!\n[MidRight]Yes, but this victory comes with a cost. We must remain vigilant.\n[MidLeft]I can't believe we actually managed to defeat Elysia. She was formidable.\n[FarLeft]Her knowledge was a weapon, but we fought for the truth!\n[FarRight]And now, we have a chance to learn from it. I want to join your mission.\n[MidRight]Darin? You wish to fight alongside us?\n[FarRight]I've seen the darkness of the Dominion. I want to seek redemption for my past.\n[MidLeft]Redemption? You think you can find it with us?\n[FarLeft]If you're willing to fight for Eldralis, then you're welcome here.\n[MidRight]Together, we can confront the darkness that threatens our land.\n[FarRight]Then it's settled. I'll prove my worth to you all.\n[MidLeft]Let's prepare for what lies ahead. The Shadow Hand won't rest for long.\n[FarLeft]We'll face them together, united as one!\n[MidRight]For Eldralis! [CloseSpeech][X]\n\n## Recruit_Ronan_Darin_Text\n[ConversationText][FarLeft][LoadRonan][FarRight][LoadElowyn]Is that a knight I sense hiding in the shadows?\n[FarLeft]I am Ronan, former knight of Verdan Hollow. What brings you to these cursed lands?\n[FarRight]We seek the ancient knowledge of the Draugrn within the Aurora Citadel. But first, we must get past a soldier who means to keep us from it.\n[FarLeft]A soldier? Who is this fool?\n[FarRight]His name is Darin. He is sworn to protect the citadel from intruders, and he's proving to be quite the obstacle.\n[FarLeft][TMM][.......]... [.......][TMM]What do you know of my past? I'm no longer that knight you once heard of. I retreated into these woods, defeated and lost.\n[FarRight]Every knight has a moment of doubt, Ronan. But you have a choice now. Stand with us, or remain in the shadows forever.\n[FarLeft]And why should I trust you?\n[FarRight]Because we are fighting for a common goal. The Shadow Hand still looms over this land. If Darin is as noble as you've been, maybe he too can be swayed to our side.\n[FarLeft]You think me noble?\n[FarRight]I think you are brave enough to reclaim your destiny.\n[FarLeft][TMM][.......]... [.......][TMM]It would seem I have no choice but to consider this.\n[FarRight]We will face the dangers ahead together!\n[FarLeft]Then it's settled. I will join you in confronting Darin. I will not fail again.\n[A][X]\n\n## Recruit_Sira_Darin_Text\n[ConversationText][FarLeft][LoadSira][Right][LoadDarin]What are you doing here? This is no place for wandering travelers!\n[FarLeft]We seek the knowledge of the draugrn and the sigils hidden within the Aurora Citadel.\n[Right]I cannot let you pass. The citadel must be protected at all costs.\n[FarLeft]But what if we could help each other?\n[Right]How do you propose we do that?\n[FarLeft]The Shadow Hand is encroaching, and with it, they are a greater threat to our world than your duty to guard this citadel.\n[Right]I've heard the tales of their darkness, but my post...\n[FarLeft]Your post will mean nothing if the Shadow Hand wipes out everyone in its path. You could join us in our fight against them.\n[Right]And why should I trust you? How do I know you won't betray me?\n[FarLeft]Because we have a common enemy. Together, we have a chance. Alone, we are all destined to fall.\n[Right][TMM][.......]... [.......][TMM]Perhaps, you make... a compelling case.\n[FarLeft]Then stand with us. Let's face the darkness together.\n[Right][TMM][.......]... [.......][TMM]Alright. Together, we will protect what is important.[CloseSpeech]\n[A][X]\n\n## Recruit_Elowyn_Darin_Text\n[ConversationText][Left][LoadElowyn][Right][LoadDarin]Halt! Who dares approach the Aurora Citadel?\n[Left]It is I, Elowyn, guardian of nature. We seek the ancient knowledge held within these lands.\n[Right]You will have to prove yourselves first. This place is guarded, and I shall protect it from intruders.\n[Left]We mean no harm; we wish to understand the sigils and their connection to the corruption plaguing Eldralis.\n[Right]And how can I trust your intentions? Too many have come seeking power.\n[Left]Because I believe in unity, not dominance. My allies and I want to restore balance to our world.\n[Right]Hmm... a noble sentiment, but words alone won't cut it. What will you do if I refuse to let you pass?\n[Left]Then, we must discuss it further. Fighting each other won't help anyone here.\n[Right]You speak wisely, Elowyn. But wisdom isn't enough when there are forces beyond your understanding.\n[Left]Then let us uncover the truth together. Show me the way, and let us confront the shadows as one.\n[Right][TMM][.......]... [.......][TMM]Maybe there is merit in what you say... you may yet prove your worth. I'll give you a chance.\n[Left]Thank you, Darin. We will not let you down!\n[A][X]",
