A deep fear of corruption looms over her, as she has seen what sigil power can do to one’s soul firsthand; her father succumbed to madness after overusing his ice sigil in the Frostpeak Mountains. Motivated by a desire to liberate her homeland and protect the innocent, Serelith seeks allies to confront the darkness rising in Eldralis, fearing that, if left unchecked, the shadows will consume everything she loves. Through her journey, she battles not only the external forces of the Crimson Empire and the Order of the Abyss but also her own inner turmoil regarding the sigil's seductive power.",
