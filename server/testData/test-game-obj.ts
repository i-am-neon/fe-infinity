His journey begins as he witnesses the simmering tensions between Valoria and Drakthar escalate, and he finds himself caught in a web of alliances and betrayals. His strengths lie in his adaptability and skill in negotiation, while his weaknesses include an intense fear of losing loved ones and a tendency to push allies away when burdened. Driven by a desire to reclaim his father from the darkness and restore balance to Eldralis, he embarks on a personal quest that might unite the fractured realm, even as he battles his own inner demons and the corrupting pull of the sigils.",
