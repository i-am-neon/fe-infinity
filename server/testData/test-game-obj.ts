      backstory:
        "Calyndra was born in Salthria, the daughter of a revered sigil craftsman. From a young age, she exhibited an innate skill for understanding and combining sigils, which made her a prodigy among her peers. However, her idyllic life was shattered when her village was attacked by the Oathbreakers, who sought to steal ancient sigils for their dark plans. During the chaos, she lost her parents, which ignited a fierce resolve within her to protect her homeland and uncover the truth behind the Oathbreakers' ambitions. Now, she fights alongside other champions from various realms, using her knowledge of sigils to unite their strengths against the looming darkness. Her strengths lie in her crafting skills and deep understanding of sigil energies, but her weakness is her emotional attachment to her lost family, which can cloud her judgment. Calyndra is motivated by the desire to prevent others from experiencing the same loss she suffered, leading her on a journey to not only combat evil but also discover her own place in the history of Eldralis.",
