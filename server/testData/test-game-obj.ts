We finally made it to the Grand Sigil Academy!\n[MidRight]I know, I can't wait to learn more about the sigils!\n[MidLeft]But have you heard the whispers? They say the Veil is planning an attack.\n[FarLeft]Yeah, I heard. It's hard to focus on our studies with all this chaos brewing.\n[MidRight]We can't let fear stop us! We need to prepare the academy for whatever comes our way.\n[MidLeft]You're right, Zylthia. We must protect our home and the knowledge it holds.\n[FarLeft]Let's gather the others and fortify the defenses. We can't let them take what's ours!\n[MidRight]Together, we'll stand against the darkness!\n[FarRight][LoadDeclan]\n[FarRight]Foolish children, you think you can stop the Veil? The sigils will be mine!\n[MidRight]Declan! You won't get away with this!\n[FarLeft]We'll fight to the end to protect the academy!\n[FarRight]Then let the battle begin! Prepare yourselves![X]\n\n\n\n## whispers_of_althryne_PostBattleScene\n[ConversationText]\n[FarRight][LoadZylthia][MidLeft][LoadIone][MidRight][LoadRonan]\nZylthia! We did it! The Veil has been pushed back for now.\n[FarRight]Yes, but at what cost? My home... it's in ruins.\n[MidLeft]We can rebuild, Zylthia. We have to protect what remains.\n[MidRight]And we will. I won't let this happen again. We need to gather allies and learn more about the Veil.\n[FarRight]I agree. Ione, your knowledge of the sigils could be crucial in our fight.\n[MidLeft]I will share everything I know. We can't let Thalthor awaken.\n[MidRight]Ronan, what about you? You seem... reluctant.\n[MidRight]I just... I never thought I'd be part of something like this again. But maybe it's time to stop running.\n[FarRight]Then it's settled. Together, we will uncover the truth and protect Eldralis from corruption.\n[MidLeft]For our home!\n[MidRight]For our future! [CloseSpeech][X]\n\n## Village_27a67466_Text\n[ConversationText]\n[MidRight][LoadCurrent][MidLeft][LoadVillagerMan1]\nAs the shadows creep closer, I can feel the tension in the air. The Veil agents are planning something big. Please, take this Killing Edge to help defend our home. It's sharp enough to cut through even the darkest of foes. We need every advantage we can get against Declan and his ruthless forces!\n[A][X]\n\n## House_2a9ba741_Text\n[ConversationText]\n[MidRight][LoadCurrent][MidLeft][LoadVillagerOldMan]\nIt's dangerous out there! The Veil agents are relentless; you must be cautious. They may be trying to exploit the academy's weaknesses to break in. Don't let your guard down, friend. This battle for the Grand Sigil Academy means everything to us!\n[A][X]\n\n## Village_5c02e4cc_Text\n[ConversationText]\n[MidRight][LoadCurrent][MidLeft][LoadVillagerMan1]\nThe village has been eerily quiet lately. People say that Declan's forces are planning an attack on the Academy. Please, take this - it will help you in your fight against the Veil! We need every advantage we can get to stand against their ambition and ruthlessness.[CloseSpeech]\n[A][X]\n\n## Village_a9e1cc86_Text\n[ConversationText]\n[MidRight][LoadCurrent][MidLeft][LoadVillagerMan2]\nThe Veil agents have been creeping closer to our village, and I fear for the safety of everyone here. Come with this, an Iron Sword, and may it help you defend against Declan's ruthless forces. Please, keep our home safe!\n[A][X]\n\n## Recruit_Ione_Ronan_Text\n[ConversationText][FarLeft][LoadZylthia][FarRight][LoadIone]Ione! Is that you? I thought I lost you in the chaos!\n[FarLeft]Zylthia! I came as soon as I heard the news. I won't let the academy fall!\n[FarRight]The Veil forces are advancing quickly. We need to act!\n[FarLeft]You're right. With your knowledge from the Grand Sigil Academy, we can strategize a defense against them.\n[FarRight]I hardly feel ready. But I will fight! My home depends on it.\n[FarLeft]That's the spirit! Your bravery will inspire everyone here. Let's hold the line together!\n[FarRight]They can't breach our defenses. I will protect this place, no matter what it takes! [TMM]I'm ready to join forces with you.\n[FarLeft]Then let's gather our allies and prepare for the battle ahead!\n[A][X]\n\n## Recruit_Zylthia_Ronan_Text\n[ConversationText][MidLeft][LoadZylthia][MidRight][LoadIone]Zylthia! We've finally arrived at the Grand Sigil Academy!\n[MidLeft]I can't wait to learn more about the sigils and their powers!\n[MidRight]Yes, but things aren't as simple as they seem...\n[MidLeft]What do you mean?\n[MidRight]I've heard whispers of a Veil attack. We must prepare ourselves!\n[MidLeft][TMM][.......]... [.......][TMM]A Veil attack? We can't let them breach the Academy!\n[MidRight]Let's secure the Northern Village first!\n[MidLeft]We'll control the flow of enemies there, and... wait!\n[MidRight]What's the matter?\n[MidLeft]I sense something... We need to fortify our positions!\n[MidRight]Right! We should also hold the Eastern Fort to create a strong line against their advance.\n[MidLeft]Good plan! And the Southern Coast will funnel the enemies... if we can just... [TMM][.......]... [.......][TMM]Hold them off long enough, we'll turn this tide!\n[MidRight]Don't forget about our friends trapped in the Northern Village!\n[MidLeft]We have to save them!

We need to discuss our next move before we reach Ironhold Keep.\n[MidRight]I agree, Ione. The Veil's forces are likely waiting for us there.\n[MidLeft]We can't let them corrupt the stronghold. We need that artifact to repel them!\n[FarLeft]But what if Kader is there? He won't let us pass easily.\n[FarRight]Then we prepare for a fight. I won't let my past dictate my future any longer.\n[MidRight]Jarek, are you sure about this? You were once aligned with them.\n[FarRight]I know what I must do. For my family... I will not fall here.\n[MidLeft]Then it's settled. We move forward together, no matter the cost.\n[MidRight]Right! Together, we can face whatever lies ahead. Let's go![X]\n\n\n\n## beneath_the_mountains_PostBattleScene\n[ConversationText]\n[MidRight][LoadZylthia][MidLeft][LoadIone][FarLeft][LoadRonan][FarRight][LoadJarek]\nZylthia! We did it! Kader is defeated!\n[MidRight]Yes, but the fight is far from over. We need to understand the Veil's true intentions.\n[MidLeft]What do you mean?\n[MidRight]They aim to awaken Thalthor, not just gather sigils. We must act quickly.\n[FarLeft]So, what's our next move?\n[MidRight]We head to Galdoran Marshes. There are secrets there that could help us stop this darkness.\n[FarRight]I'll follow you anywhere, Zylthia. I owe it to my clan to fight against this corruption.\n[MidLeft]And I'll stand by your side, no matter what.\n[MidRight]Together, we can uncover the truth and protect our homes. Let's move out![X]\n\n## Village_3201fdb6_Text\n[ConversationText]\n[MidRight][LoadCurrent][MidLeft][LoadVillagerMan1]\nThe villagers have been on edge lately, what with Kader's forces looming in the mountains. We've heard whispers about their plans to attack.\n\n[CloseSpeech]\n[MidRight]You need to be cautious if you venture into the Northern Peaks; they have the high ground and won't hesitate to use it.\n\n[CloseSpeech]\n[Left][LoadVillagerWoman]\nBut here, take this Thani we managed to hide! It's better suited in your hands than just gathering dust. We hope it helps you face the dangers ahead.\n\n[CloseSpeech]\n[A][X]\n\n## House_265c379b_Text\n[ConversationText]\n[MidRight][LoadCurrent][MidLeft][LoadVillagerOldWoman]\nBe careful as you traverse these mountains, young traveler. Kader's troops are relentless, and they've forsaken any sense of honor. It might seem easy to think you can appeal to their better nature, but I fear they will strike with vengeance. Keep your wits about you, and trust not just in strength, but in your mind.\n[A][X]\n\n## House_8ab53d7d_Text\n[ConversationText]\n[MidRight][LoadCurrent][MidLeft][LoadVillagerOldMan]  \nBeware of the treachery that lurks in these hills, traveler. Kader's warriors are not to be underestimated. They fight with fervor, driven by vengeance and desperation.\n[CloseSpeech]  \n[MidLeft]If you plan to confront him, tread carefully and consider your allies. Trust can be a fragile thing in these dark times.\n[A][X]\n\n## Recruit_Ione_Jarek_Text\n[ConversationText][MidLeft][LoadIone][MidRight][LoadJarek]Are you really considering joining forces with Kader? \n[MidRight]I have my own reasons, Ione. This isn't just about alliances anymore.\n[MidLeft]You may have your reasons, but Kader is not someone you can trust. Why would you even think of siding with him?\n[MidRight]When you see what he can offer, it's hard to say no. Power... safety for my people.\n[MidLeft][TMM][.......]... [.......][TMM]Power? At what cost? You know the Veil will twist anyone's mind for their own gain!\n[MidRight]And what do you propose? Just stand back while he takes everything? \n[MidLeft]No, I propose we fight! We can confront Kader's forces and show him that his influence is weak!\n[MidRight]You think it's that easy? We must think things through...\n[MidLeft]Or we risk losing everything! \n[MidRight]But I... I don't know if I can turn against him.\n[MidLeft]Then don't think about turning against him, think about who you truly stand with. Are you with Kader or with us? \n[MidRight]If only it was that simple. My heart says one thing, but... My mind is clouded. \n[MidLeft]Then let's clear your mind with action! Join us, and you can help us push back against the Veil! \n[MidRight][TMM][.......]... [.......][TMM]Alright Ione, I'm in. Together, we can take back what belongs to us![Smile] \n[MidLeft]You won't regret this, Jarek. Together, we'll guard the light of Ironhold!\n[A][X]\n\n## Recruit_Ronan_Jarek_Text\n[ConversationText][FarLeft][LoadRonan][Right][LoadZylthia]Ronan, we need to move quickly. Kader's forces won't wait for us to get ready.\n[FarLeft]Are you sure you want to do this, Zylthia? Playing heroes against Kader is a dangerous game.\n[Right]Sometimes danger is the only way to make a difference. We can't let Ironhold fall into their hands.\n[FarLeft]And what about the artifact? Do we even know if it has the power we need?\n[Right]It's rumored to repel the Veil. Even if it's just a rumor, it may be our only shot.\n[FarLeft]A rumor, huh? Trusting in whispers is not exactly my style.\n[Right]We must trust in something, Ronan. If we don't believe in the cause, then what are we fighting for?\n[FarLeft]I get it. Just know that if we charge in without caution... we'll just be feeding Kader's ambition.\n[Right]Point noted. Let's prepare strategically, then. Death in that keep would mean nothing.\n[FarLeft]Then let's even the odds. If we find a way to draw them out, we can shift the tide.\n[Right][TMM][.......]... [.......][TMM]I like the sound of that![Smile][ClearFace]Let's show Kader what happens when you underestimate your opponents.\n[A][X]\n\n## Recruit_Zylthia_Jarek_Text\n[ConversationText][FarLeft][LoadZylthia][MidRight][LoadJarek]Zylthia: Jarek, wait! We're here to help you! \n[FarLeft]I can't let you pass! I won't fall to the Veil again! \n[MidRight]But we're facing Kader together. The Veil is manipulating us all! \n[FarLeft]You don't understand! I'm responsible for what happened last time. \n[MidRight]No, you're not! You were a victim just like the rest of us! \n[FarLeft]I can't trust anyone anymore. \n[MidRight]You have to believe me. We can defeat Kader if we join forces! \n[FarLeft]What if I fail again? What if I'm not strong enough? \n[MidRight]You've grown stronger! You've learned from the past. \n[FarLeft]But what if my mistakes lead to our defeat?  \n[MidRight]We face those fears together. You have the strength to fight this. \n[FarLeft][TMM][.......]... [.......][TMM]What do I have to lose? \n[MidRight]Exactly! Let's push back against the Veil and reclaim our future! \n[FarLeft][CloseSpeech] \n[MidRight][CloseSpeech]\n[A][X]",
