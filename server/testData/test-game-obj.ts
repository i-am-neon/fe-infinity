We need to discuss the Braxian Brotherhood's movements.\n[MidLeft]I know, Kieran. The whispers have reached me as well. We must secure the support of the Sigil Keepers before it's too late.\n[FarRight]But what if they refuse? We can't afford to be caught off guard!\n[MidLeft]I understand your concern. But we must approach this with caution. The tension is palpable, and we cannot let our emotions dictate our actions.\n[FarRight]Caution? They are our enemies! We should strike first!\n[MidLeft]No, Kieran. We need allies, not more enemies. If we can convince the Sigil Keepers to join us, we stand a better chance against Ronan and his ambitions.\n[FarRight]Ronan... that cunning snake. He won't stop until he has the sigils for himself.\n[MidLeft]Exactly. We must be prepared for his tricks. Let's move quickly; the longer we wait, the more dangerous this becomes.\n[FarRight]Right! For Aeloria! Let's show them the strength of our resolve! [CloseSpeech][X]\n\n\n\n## the_gathering_storm_PostBattleReflection\n[ConversationText]\n[MidRight][LoadSeraphel][FarLeft][LoadKieran]\nWe did it, Kieran. Ronan is defeated.\n[MidRight]It was a hard-fought battle, but we stood our ground.\n[FarLeft]I never expected you to be so strong, Seraphel. You really rallied everyone.\n[MidRight]I couldn't have done it without the support of my allies. We all fought together.\n[FarLeft]And now, the Sigil Keepers are with us. This is just the beginning, isn't it?\n[MidRight]Yes, but the Order of the Awakened is still out there. We must remain vigilant.\n[FarLeft]I won't back down. If they threaten our home, I'll fight for it.\n[MidRight]That's the spirit! Together, we can face whatever comes our way.\n[FarLeft]I just hope we can forge stronger bonds as we move forward. We need each other now more than ever.\n[MidRight]Agreed. The darkness may loom, but with our unity, we can light the way ahead.[X]\n\n## House_3f0e5b51_Text\n[ConversationText]\n[MidRight][LoadCurrent][MidLeft][LoadVillagerOldWoman]\nYou there! Tread carefully around these parts! Rumors are swirling about Ronan and his men getting ready to strike. I can feel it in the air... If you are caught unprepared, it could spell disaster for our village. Stay vigilant!\n[A][X]\n\n## Village_59eb92d3_Text\n[ConversationText]\n[MidRight][LoadCurrent][MidLeft][LoadVillagerOldMan]\nAh, you've made it to the village! These lands are under threat from Ronan and his Braxian forces. You must be careful on your journey, but take this Divine blessing as a token of our gratitude. It will lend you strength in the battles to come.\n[A][X]\n\n## House_fe5a7430_Text\n[ConversationText]\n[MidRight][LoadCurrent][MidLeft][LoadVillagerOldMan]\nI've seen many battles in my days...\nBut these foes are like no other. Beware\nof their cunning leader, Ronan. He sees\nopportunities where others see defeat.\nStay sharp, and don't let your guard down!\n[A][X]\n\n## House_c98e59ce_Text\n[ConversationText]\n[MidRight][LoadCurrent][MidLeft][LoadVillagerOldWoman]The world is a dangerous place with Ronan on the prowl. Take heed, and do not underestimate his cunning. His forces will stop at nothing to claim victory. If you must fight, do so with caution and always keep your allies close.  [CloseSpeech]\n[A][X]\n\n## Village_9cb83f38_Text\n[ConversationText]\n[MidRight][LoadCurrent][MidLeft][LoadVillagerMan2]\nWelcome, traveler! The skies are dark with conflict, and Ronan's forces are looming. We fear for our village and hope to keep our people safe. If you can help us, please take this gold, it should aid you in the fight ahead. Every little bit counts against such a cunning foe.\n[A][X]\n\n## Recruit_Seraphel_Kieran_Text\n[ConversationText][FarFarLeft][LoadSeraphel][FarLeft][LoadRonan][MidLeft]The Braxian Brotherhood isn't far. We must prepare![CloseSpeech]\n[MidRight]Seraphel, they won't let us pass quietly.[CloseSpeech]\n[FarLeft]Then we'll have to face them head-on. I've come too far to back down now.[CloseSpeech]\n[MidLeft]You're not alone in this fight.[CloseSpeech]\n[MidRight]I won't let them intimidate us, either. The Sigil Keepers stand firm![CloseSpeech]\n[FarLeft][TMM][.......]... [.......][TMM]If we protect the sacred grounds, we can rally our forces and strike back at the heart of the Brotherhood.[CloseSpeech]\n[MidRight]But what if they're already planning to ambush us at the Northern Plains?[CloseSpeech]\n[MidLeft]Then we readjust our strategy. We cannot afford to be caught off guard.[CloseSpeech]\n[FarFarLeft]The forest offers cover and the cliffs provide high ground for our archers. We need to use every advantage we have.[CloseSpeech]\n[MidRight]I'll gather the archers and mages to cover our flanks.[CloseSpeech]\n[FarLeft]Good. If we can secure the villages, we'll have enough resources to sustain our fight.[CloseSpeech]\n[MidLeft]It all comes down to this moment. We fight for our homeland and the hope of the Sigil Keepers![CloseSpeech]\n[MidRight][TMM][.......]... [.......][TMM]Together, we will forge a future free from the shadows of the Brotherhood.[ClearFace]\n[A][X]",

        "Seraphel hails from Aeloria, where she grew up amid the lush forests and mystical Glimmering Woods. As a child, she often heard stories of the ancient sigils and their power, igniting a desire to understand their true nature. However, her idyllic upbringing was shattered when her family was targeted by a rival faction seeking to acquire their sigil. Her parents fell victim to the corrupting power of the sigil, leaving her to grow up grappling with the pain of loss and the thirst for justice. Possessing an innate connection to nature, Seraphel embodies the strength and resilience of Aeloria's guardians. Her deep desire to protect her homeland and restore balance drives her on a personal journey of healing, seeking allies from across Eldralis to confront the looming threat of the Order of the Awakened. Despite her unwavering determination, she often wrestles with self-doubt, fearing she may fall prey to the same corruption that claimed her family. As she faces the darkness, she must navigate her path, forging bonds with those from rival factions, and building her inner strength to become the true protector Eldralis needs.",
