We need to discuss our next move.\n[MidLeft]I agree, Liora. The tension here is palpable, and we must act quickly.\n[MidRight]What do we know about Eldric's ambitions?\n[FarRight]Eldric seeks the sigil of storm control. If he gets it, he could tip the balance of power in Eldralis.\n[MidLeft]We cannot allow that to happen. We must confront him before he can make his move.\n[MidRight]But how do we approach this? He has a strong following.\n[FarRight]We need to secure an alliance with the Caldorian Warriors. They can help us stand against him.\n[MidLeft]Then it's settled.

Let's gather the others and plan our next move.[X]\n\n## Recruit_Liora_Ronan_Text\n[ConversationText][MidLeft][LoadLiora][MidRight][LoadTziela]Liora, I need your guidance as we face this new threat.\n[MidLeft]Tziela, the forest whispers have warned me of Eldric's ambition. \n[MidRight]What should we do? Every moment counts! \n[MidLeft]We must unite the Caldorian Warriors, but first, we need to understand the full scope of this conflict. \n[MidRight]You mean to say we should gather information before charging in?\n[MidLeft]Yes. Knowledge is power, and with your resolve, we can turn the tides. \n[MidRight]Then let us move swiftly. If Eldric seeks the sigil, we cannot let him get it.\n[MidLeft]Agreed.

No, I aim to control the storm. With the sigil, I can maintain order.\n[FarRight]You misunderstand. Control isn't harmony. You will destroy what you seek to protect.\n[FarLeft][TMM][.......]... [.......][TMM]And who says you understand balance better than I?\n[FarRight]My perspective is different than yours. I have seen the suffering of the factions, I will not let your arrogance ruin what little peace we have.\n[FarLeft]Peace? You are naive, thinking you can change the world by embracing the weak.\n[FarRight]Strength and kindness can coexist. I will not let you endanger the world I love.\n[FarLeft][TMM][.......]... [.......][TMM]You think you can stop me? You're just a druid lost in your ideals.\n[FarRight]No, I am a protector of this land.\n[FarLeft]Protect it all you want, it won't change anything.\n[FarRight]You underestimate the power of unity. The Caldorian Warriors stand with me.\n[FarLeft][TMM][.......]... [.......][TMM]Allies won't save you in the face of true power, Tziela.\n[FarRight]Then let us test that theory. I will stand against you, for Eldralis!\n[A][X]",

Blessed with a unique connection to nature, she learned the ways of the ancients and the importance of maintaining balance in the world. However, her peaceful life was shattered when Noxhaven's shadowy forces began encroaching upon her homeland, corrupting the sacred sigils that protected the land. Determined to save her people and their way of life, Tziela journeyed beyond her sanctuary and into the heart of the conflicts tearing Eldralis apart. Her strengths lie in her deep-rooted understanding of nature and her capacity for empathy; she often acts as a mediator between warring factions. Yet, her kindness can also be her weakness, leading her to trust too easily or sacrifice her well-being for the sake of others. Motivated by her passion for life and the desire to restore balance in her fractured world, Tziela embarks on a quest that not only tests her abilities but guides her on a personal journey of self-discovery and resilience.",
